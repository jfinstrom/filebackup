# Filebackup
This is an example module that shows a bare minimum way to backup files in FreePBXÂ® 15

## Introduction

In backup 15 the modules control what they need to backup and restore. There is no method of adding extra files to the backup.
This module demonstrates a way to add needed files to a skeleton module to add them to the backup.
It probably makes more sense to use a database and UI to make this more managable. This is not meant to be a "complete tool" but more as a demo.
